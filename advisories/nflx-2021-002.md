###### Title: Local information disclosure in Priam

###### Release Date: 2021-03-23

###### Severity: Low

###### Credit:  Security Researcher Jonathan Leitschuh

### Overview:
Security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh reported that Netflix Priam (a Netflix OSS project available here: https://github.com/Netflix/Priam) writes to a local temporary file with world-readable permissions.

### Impact:
An attacker with read access to the local filesystem can read anything written there by the Priam process.

### Description:
Priam uses File.createTempFile, which gives the permissions on that file -rw-r--r--.

[Further details are available from the original reporter](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-f4jh-ww96-9h9j).

### Workarounds and Fixes
Avoid running Hollow in configurations that share a filesystem with less-trusted processes. May be fixed in a future release.
