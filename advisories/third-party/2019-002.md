###### Title: HTTP/2 Denial of Service Advisory

###### Release Date: 2019-08-13

###### Severity: High

### Overview:

Netflix has discovered several resource exhaustion vectors affecting a
variety of third-party HTTP/2 implementations. These attack vectors
can be used to launch DoS attacks against servers that support HTTP/2
communication.

Netflix worked with Google and CERT/CC to coordinate disclosure to the
Internet community.

Today, a number of vendors have announced patches to correct this
suboptimal behavior. While we haven’t detected these vulnerabilities
in our open source packages, we are issuing this security advisory to
document our findings and to further assist the Internet security
community in remediating these issues.

### Impact:

There are three broad areas of information security: confidentiality
(information can’t be read by unauthorized people), integrity
(information can’t be changed by unauthorized people), and
availability (information and systems are available when you want
them). All of the changes announced today are in the “availability”
category. __These HTTP/2 vulnerabilities do not allow an attacker to
leak or modify information__.

Rather, they allow a small number of low bandwidth malicious sessions
to prevent connection participants from doing additional work. These
attacks are likely to exhaust resources such that other connections or
processes on the same machine may also be impacted or crash.

### The Weaknesses:

HTTP/2 (defined in RFCs 7540 and 7541) represents a significant change
from HTTP/1.1. There are several new capabilities, including header
compression and multiplexing of data from multiple streams, which make
this attractive to the user community. To support these new features,
HTTP/2 has grown to encompass some of the complexity of a Layer 3
transport protocol:

* Data is now carried in binary frames;
* There are both per-connection and per-stream windows that define how much data can be sent;
* There are several ICMP-like control messages (ping, reset, and settings frames, for example) which operate at the HTTP/2 connection layer; and,
* This is a fairly robust concept of stream prioritization.

While this added complexity enables some exciting new features, it
also raises implementation questions. When implementations run on the
internet and are exposed to malicious users, implementers may wonder:

* Should I limit any of the control messages?
* How do I implement the priority queueing scheme in a computationally efficient way?
* How do I implement the flow-control algorithms in a computationally efficient way?
* How could an attacker manipulate the flow-control algorithm at the HTTP/2 layer to cause unintended results? (And, can they manipulate the flow-control algorithms at both the HTTP/2 and TCP layers together to cause unintended results?)

The Security Considerations section of RFC 7540 (see Section 10.5)
addresses some of this in a general way. However, unlike the expected
“normal” behavior—which is well-documented and which implementations
seem to follow very closely—the algorithms and mechanisms for
detecting and mitigating “abnormal” behavior are significantly more
vague and left as an exercise for the implementer. From a review of
various software packages, it appears that this has led to a variety
of implementations with a variety of good ideas, but also some
weaknesses.

### Why does this matter?

Most of these attacks work at the HTTP/2 transport layer. As
illustrated in the diagram below, this layer sits above the TLS
transport, but below the concept of a request. In fact, many of these
attacks involve either 0 or 1 requests.

Since the early days of HTTP, tooling has been oriented around
requests: logs often indicate requests (rather than connections);
rate-limiting may occur at the request level; and, traffic controls
may be triggered by requests.

By contrast, there is not as much tooling that looks at HTTP/2
connections to log, rate-limit, and trigger remediation based on a
client’s behavior at the HTTP/2 connection layer. Therefore,
organizations may find it more difficult to discover and block
malicious HTTP/2 connections and may need to add additional tooling to
handle these situations.

These attack vectors allow a remote attacker to consume excessive
system resources. Some are efficient enough that a single end-system
could potentially cause havoc on multiple servers. Other attacks are
less efficient; however, even less efficient attacks can open the door
for DDoS attacks which are difficult to detect and block.

### Attacks

Many of the attack vectors we found (and which were fixed today) are
variants on a theme: a malicious client asks the server to do
something which generates a response, but the client refuses to read
the response. This exercises the server’s queue management
code. Depending on how the server handles its queues, the client can
force it to consume excess memory and CPU while processing its
requests.

These are the attacks which are being disclosed today, all discovered by Jonathan Looney of Netflix, except for CVE-2019-9518 which was discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google:
* __CVE-2019-9511 “Data Dribble”__: The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9512 “Ping Flood”__: The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9513 “Resource Loop”__: The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9514 “Reset Flood”__: The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9515 “Settings Flood”__: The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9516 “0-Length Headers Leak”__: The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9517 “Internal Data Buffering”__: The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* __CVE-2019-9518 “Empty Frames Flood”__: The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google)

### Workarounds and Fixes

In most cases, an immediate workaround is to disable HTTP/2
support. However, this may cause performance degradation, and it might
not be possible in all cases.  To obtain software fixes, please
contact your software vendor. More information can also be found in
the [CERT/CC vulnerability
note](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/605641/) (when it is released).
