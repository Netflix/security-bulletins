###### Title: Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens exposure in Dispatch

###### Release Date: 2023-08-17

###### Severity: Critical

###### Credit: [mr-n30](https://github.com/mr-n30)

### Overview:

Server response includes the JWT Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens in error message.

### Impact:

Any Dispatch users who own their instance and rely on the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin for authentication may be impacted, allowing for any account to be taken over within their own instance. This could be done by using the secret to sign attacker crafted JWTs.

### Description:

Dispatch is an open source security incident management tool. The server response includes the JWT Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens in error message when the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin encounters an error when attempting to decode a JWT token.

### Workarounds and Fixes

If you think that you may be impacted, we strongly suggest you to rotate the secret stored in the `DISPATCH_JWT_SECRET` envvar in the `.env` file. This issue was addressed in [PR](https://github.com/Netflix/dispatch/pull/3695) and a [new release](https://github.com/Netflix/dispatch/releases/tag/latest) with the fix was created. Please, upgrade your Dispatch instances to the new version.

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
